	 I was really interested in fashion since my teen days. I never had chance to chase my passion for modeling and this fashion industry due to the environment 
	that i lived in so i wanted every other teen to go and grab their passion. Therefore i am giving them this flatform to chase their passion, to know their goals and
	furthermore to find the ways to serve back to this industry and also to the society through their skills and ability.

	Being yougest son of my family turned out to be huge blessing for me. I used to be really happy when i get to try out new clothes and shoes.I used to stand infront of the mirror looking at myself in those new clothes and shoe.My brother were super supportive when i said i wanted to be model.They let me go and achieve my dreams. But not every one 
	have brothers like me and lucky as me when it comes to achieve their goals in fashion industry so i wanted to help all those people looking forward this fashion industry as a big brothers through HOF. </div>

	I started my journey in 1991/92 when the fashion industry was relatively unknown. There was an Indian program "Model Watch" in Zee TV where I won the model of the week. That can be considered as my first accomplishment internationally. I mean being recognized by Zee TV [at that time] was a huge deal. It was the first a Nepali face won something as a model in an international platform. I was around 18 years old and didn't know much about it. I also got the opportunity to act in the Hollywood movie "Little Buddha" starring Keanu Reaves around the same time. I was a very big platform for me to be a part of such a big project.Now with HOF i want people to know this industry and have hope that this industry also can serve you.</div>
